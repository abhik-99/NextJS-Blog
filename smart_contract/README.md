# Simple Hardhat Project

This is the simple Hardhat project to showcase how to use NextJs 13 with Next Auth and Wagmi/Viem. The hardhat project uses Ethers v5.x and contains the following contracts:
1. A `TestNFT` contract
2. A `Greeting` contract

Both of the above contracts have been deployed to Mumbai Testnet and verified at the following addresses respectively - [0x984971D869173102b36312A3EE9B4C476BdA0aE2](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x984971D869173102b36312A3EE9B4C476BdA0aE2#code) and [0x2459b55d846656f9BD9ddA049662f5da80B7c534](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x2459b55d846656f9BD9ddA049662f5da80B7c534#code).

Please note that I haven't really paid a mind to optimization as the purpose of this mini-project is to demonstrate the usage of Next Auth and Viem. Refer to my dev.to account for the full series. Cheers!
